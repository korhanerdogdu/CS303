## üöÄ How to Use

- Browse the repository to review my lab solutions and project files.
- Each directory contains:
  - Circuit files (e.g., `.dig` files for Digital simulator)
  - FPGA source files where applicable
  - Documentation or reports as required by the assignment

Example usage:
- Open `.dig` files in [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) simulator.
- Use provided files in your FPGA development environment for Tang Nano 9K.
